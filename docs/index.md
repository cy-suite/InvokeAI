For full documentation for mkdocs, visit [mkdocs.org](https://www.mkdocs.org).
  The Docs you find here (/docs/*) are built and deployed via mkdocs. If you want to run a local version to verify your changes, it's as simple as::

  ```bash
  pip install -r docs/requirements-mkdocs.txt
  mkdocs serve

## Welcome to Smile4yourself's Document Testing Git

My purpose in this Git Repo is to organize the Invoke Document 

A secondary purpose is to determine how to use `mkdocs` -a python application for creating web sites used by GitHub. That is what was used to create the orriginal website on Github.


## Proposed Layout of Website

Top Level Menus:

    HOME    INSTALL     DOCS   TUTORIALS       VERSIONS        ROADMAP     CONTRIBUTE      KUDOS            



This menu is created simply my placing markdown files with those names inside the "docs" directory.
They are in alphabetical Order, not how I placed them here...

The Headings used in index.md create a menu on the left side of the page. Like it or not.


The Style is controlled by the settings in `mkdocs.yml`
