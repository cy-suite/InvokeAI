## Welcome to Smile4yourself's Document Testing Git

My purpose in this Git Repo is to organize the Invoke Document 

A secondary purpose is to determine how to use `mkdocs` -a python application for creating web sites used by GitHub.


## Proposed Layout of Website

Top Level Menus:

    HOME    INSTALL     DOCS   TUTORIALS       VERSIONS        ROADMAP     CONTRIBUTE      KUDOS            



This menu is created simply my placing markdown files with those names inside the "docs" directory.
They are in alphabetical Order, not how I placed them here...

The Headings used in index.md create a menu on the left side of the page. Like it or not.


## The Style is controlled by the settings in `mkdocs.yml`
