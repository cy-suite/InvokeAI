### Step 2: Download the Launcher

Download the most recent launcher for your operating system:

- [Download for Windows](https://download.invoke.ai/Invoke-Installer-windows-x64.exe)
- [Download for macOS](https://download.invoke.ai/Invoke-Installer-mac-arm64.dmg)
- [Download for Linux](https://download.invoke.ai/Invoke-Installer-linux-x86_64.AppImage)

### Step 3: Install or Update Invoke

Run the launcher you just downloaded. You’ll have two options:

1. **Launch / update from an existing installation:**
   - If you installed Invoke previously, click *Select an existing installation* to connect to it. You'll be able to update or launch the existing installation.
   
2. **Launch from a fresh installation:**
   - Click *Install* to set up a new instance of Invoke.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup.

### Step 4: Run Invoke from Your Browser

Once installed, click Finish, then Launch to start Invoke.

- The very first run after an installation will take a few extra moments to get ready. It will be faster after the first run.

### Step 5: Install a Starter Model Pack or Locate Models On Your Hard Drive

After launching Invoke:

1. Go to the **Model Manager** tab.
2. Install one of the suggested Starter Model packs. If you already have models installed on your hard drive, you can provide that folder location and Invoke will automatically add those models to your studio.

You’re now ready to start creating!
