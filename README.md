## Quick Start

For full installation and upgrade instructions, please see:
[InvokeAI Installation Overview](https://invoke-ai.github.io/InvokeAI/installation/INSTALLATION/)

If upgrading from version 2.3, please read [Migrating a 2.3 root
directory to 3.0](#migrating-to-3) first.

### Automatic Installer (suggested for 1st time users)

1. Go to the bottom of the [Latest Release Page](https://github.com/invoke-ai/InvokeAI/releases/latest)

2. Download the .zip file for your OS (Windows/macOS/Linux).

3. Unzip the file.

4. **Windows:** double-click on the `install.bat` script. **macOS:** Open a Terminal window, drag the file `install.sh` from Finder
into the Terminal, and press return. **Linux:** run `install.sh`.

5. You'll be asked to confirm the location of the folder in which
to install InvokeAI and its image generation model files. Pick a
location with at least 15 GB of free memory. More if you plan on
installing lots of models.

6. Wait while the installer does its thing. After installing the software,
the installer will launch a script that lets you configure InvokeAI and
select a set of starting image generation models.

7. Find the folder that InvokeAI was installed into (it is not the
same as the unpacked zip file directory!) The default location of this
folder (if you didn't change it in step 5) is `~/invokeai` on
Linux/Mac systems, and `C:\Users\YourName\invokeai` on Windows. This directory will contain launcher scripts named `invoke.sh` and `invoke.bat`.

8. On Windows systems, double-click on the `invoke.bat` file. On
macOS, open a Terminal window, drag `invoke.sh` from the folder into
the Terminal, and press return. On Linux, run `invoke.sh`

9. Press 1 to open the "browser-based UI", press enter/return, wait a
minute or two for Stable Diffusion to start up, then open your browser
and go to http://localhost:9090.

10. Type `banana sushi` in the box on the top left and click `Invoke`

### Command-Line Installation (for developers and users familiar with Terminals)

You must have Python 3.10 through 3.11 installed on your machine. Earlier or
later versions are not supported.
Node.js also needs to be installed along with `pnpm` (can be installed with
the command `npm install -g pnpm` if needed)

1. Open a command-line window on your machine. The PowerShell is recommended for Windows.
2. Create a directory to install InvokeAI into. You'll need at least 15 GB of free space:

    ```terminal
    mkdir invokeai
    ````

3. Create a virtual environment named `.venv` inside this directory and activate it:

    ```terminal
    cd invokeai
    python -m venv .venv --prompt InvokeAI
    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment (do it every time you run InvokeAI)

    _For Linux/Mac users:_

    ```sh
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

    _For Windows users:_

    ```ps
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

5. Install the InvokeAI module and its dependencies. Choose the command suited for your platform & GPU.

    _For Windows/Linux with an NVIDIA GPU:_

    ```terminal
    pip install "InvokeAI[xformers]" --use-pep517 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
    ```

    _For Linux with an AMD GPU:_

    ```sh
    pip install InvokeAI --use-pep517 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm5.6
    ```

    _For non-GPU systems:_
    ```terminal
    pip install InvokeAI --use-pep517 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
    ``` 

    _For Macintoshes, either Intel or M1/M2/M3:_

    ```sh
    pip install InvokeAI --use-pep517
    ```

6. Launch the web server (do it every time you run InvokeAI):

    ```terminal
    invokeai-web
    ```

7. Point your browser to http://localhost:9090 to bring up the web interface.

8. Type `banana sushi` in the box on the top left and click `Invoke`.

Be sure to activate the virtual environment each time before re-launching InvokeAI,
using `source .venv/bin/activate` or `.venv\Scripts\activate`.

## Detailed Installation Instructions

This fork is supported across Linux, Windows and Macintosh. Linux
users can use either an Nvidia-based card (with CUDA support) or an
AMD card (using the ROCm driver). For full installation and upgrade
instructions, please see:
[InvokeAI Installation Overview](https://invoke-ai.github.io/InvokeAI/installation/INSTALL_SOURCE/)

## Hardware Requirements

InvokeAI is supported across Linux, Windows and macOS. Linux
users can use either an Nvidia-based card (with CUDA support) or an
AMD card (using the ROCm driver).

### System

You will need one of the following:

- An NVIDIA-based graphics card with 4 GB or more VRAM memory. 6-8 GB
  of VRAM is highly recommended for rendering using the Stable
  Diffusion XL models
- An Apple computer with an M1 chip.
- An AMD-based graphics card with 4GB or more VRAM memory (Linux
  only), 6-8 GB for XL rendering.

We do not recommend the GTX 1650 or 1660 series video cards. They are
unable to run in half-precision mode and do not have sufficient VRAM
to render 512x512 images.

**Memory** - At least 12 GB Main Memory RAM.

**Disk** - At least 12 GB of free disk space for the machine learning model, Python, and all its dependencies.
