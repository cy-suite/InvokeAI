# Stable Diffusion Dream Script

This is a fork of CompVis/stable-diffusion, the wonderful open source
text-to-image generator. The original has been improved in several ways:

## Interactive command-line interface similar to the Discord bot

The *dream.py* script, located in scripts/dream.py, 
provides an interactive interface to image generation similar to
the "dream mothership" bot that Stable AI provided on its Discord
server. Unlike the txt2img.py and img2img.py scripts provided in the
original CompViz/stable-diffusion source code repository, the
time-consuming initialization of the AI model
initialization only happens once. After that image generation 
from the command-line interface is very fast.

The script uses the readline library to allow for in-line editing,
command history (up and down arrows), autocompletion, and more. To help
keep track of which prompts generated which images, the script writes a
log file of image names and prompts to the selected output directory.
In addition, as of version 1.02, it also writes the prompt into the PNG
file's metadata where it can be retrieved using scripts/images2prompt.py

The script is confirmed to work on Linux and Windows systems. It should
work on MacOSX as well, but this is not confirmed. Note that this script
runs from the command-line (CMD or Terminal window), and does not have a GUI.

The dream> prompt's arguments are pretty much identical to those used
in the Discord bot, except you don't need to type "!dream" (it doesn't
hurt if you do). A significant change is that creation of individual
images is now the default unless --grid (-g) is given. For backward
compatibility, the -i switch is recognized.  For command-line help
type -h (or --help) at the dream> prompt.

The script itself also recognizes a series of command-line switches
that will change important global defaults, such as the directory for
image outputs and the location of the model weight files.

## Image-to-Image

This script also provides an img2img feature that lets you seed your
creations with a drawing or photo. This is a really cool feature that tells
stable diffusion to build the prompt on top of the image you provide, preserving
the original's basic shape and layout. To use it, provide the --init_img 
option as shown here:

~~~~
dream> "waterfall and rainbow" --init_img=./init-images/crude_drawing.png --strength=0.5 -s100 -n4
~~~~

The --init_img (-I) option gives the path to the seed picture. --strength (-f) controls how much
the original will be modified, ranging from 0.0 (keep the original intact), to 1.0 (ignore the original
completely). The default is 0.75, and ranges from 0.25-0.75 give interesting results.

You may also pass a -v<count> option to generate count variants on the original image. This is done by
passing the first generated image back into img2img the requested number of times. It generates interesting
variants.

## GFPGAN Support

This script also provides the ability to invoke GFPGAN after image
generation. Doing so will enhance faces and optionally upscale the
image to a higher resolution.

To use the ability, clone the [GFPGAN
repository](https://github.com/TencentARC/GFPGAN) and follow their
installation instructions. By default, we expect GFPGAN to be
installed in a 'GFPGAN' sibling directory. Be sure that the "ldm"
conda environment is active as you install GFPGAN.

You may also want to install Real-ESRGAN, if you want to enhance
non-face regions in the image, by installing the pip Real-ESRGAN
package.

```
pip install realesrgan

```

Users whose GPU machines are isolated from the Internet (e.g. on a
University cluster) should be aware that the first time you run
dream.py with GFPGAN turned on, it will try to download model files
from the Internet. To rectify this, you may run `python3
scripts/preload_models.pl` after you have installed GFPGAN and all its
dependencies.

Now, you can run this script by adding the **--gfpgan** option. Any
issues with GFPGAN will be reported on initialization.

~~~~
(ldm) ~/stable-diffusion$ python3 ./scripts/dream.py --gfpgan
* Initializing, be patient...
(...more initialization messages...)
* --gfpgan was specified, loading gfpgan...
(...even more initialization messages...)
* Initialization done! Awaiting your command...
~~~~

When generating prompts, add a -G or --gfpgan_strenth option to
control the strength of the GFPGAN enhancement. 0.0 is no
enhancement, 1.0 is maximum enhancement.

So for instance, to apply the maximum strength:
~~~~
dream> a man wearing a pineapple hat -G 1
~~~~

This also works with img2img:
~~~
dream> a man wearing a pineapple hat -I path/to/your/file.png -G 1
~~~

That's it!

There's also a bunch of options to control GFPGAN settings when
starting the script for different configs that you can read about in
the help text. This will let you control where GFPGAN is installed, if
upsampling is enabled, the upsampler to use and the model path.

By default, images will be upscaled by 2-fold, meaning that the old
Stable Diffusion default size of 512x512 will now be a glorious
detailed 1024x1024. The extent of upscaling is set when you run the
script, and can't be changed while it's running. However, at any time
you may specify **-G0** to turn off upscaling and facial enhancement
for that image or set of images.

Note that loading GFPGAN consumes additional GPU memory, and will add
a few seconds to image generation. However, if can afford a 3090s with
24Gi, the results are well worth it.

## Barebones Web Server

As of version 1.10, this distribution comes with a bare bones web
server (see screenshot). To use it, run the command:

~~~~
(ldm) ~/stable-diffusion$ python3 scripts/dream_web.py
~~~~

You can then connect to the server by pointing your web browser at
http://localhost:9090, or to the network name or IP address of the server.

Kudos to [Tesseract Cat](https://github.com/TesseractCat) for
contributing this code.

![Dream Web Server](static/dream_web_server.png)

## Reading Prompts from a File

You can automate dream.py by providing a text file with the prompts
you want to run, one line per prompt. The text file must be composed
with a text editor (e.g. Notepad) and not a word processor. Each line
should look like what you would type at the dream> prompt:

~~~~
a beautiful sunny day in the park, children playing -n4 -C10
stormy weather on a mountain top, goats grazing     -s100
innovative packaging for a squid's dinner           -S137038382
~~~~

Then pass this file's name to dream.py when you invoke it:

~~~~
(ldm) ~/stable-diffusion$ python3 scripts/dream.py --from_file="path/to/prompts.txt"
~~~~

## Shortcut for reusing seeds from the previous command

Since it is so common to reuse seeds while refining a prompt, there is
now a shortcut as of version 1.11. Provide a **-S** (or **--seed**)
switch of -1 to use the seed of the most recent image generated. If
you produced multiple images with the **-n** switch, then you can go
back further using -2, -3, etc. up to the first image generated by the
previous command. Sorry, but you can't go back further than one
command.

Here's an example of using this to do a quick refinement. It also
illustrates using the new **-G** switch to turn on upscaling and
face enhancement (see previous section):

~~~~
dream> a cute child playing hopscotch -G0.5
[...]
outputs/img-samples/000039.3498014304.png: "a cute child playing hopscotch" -s50 -b1 -W512 -H512 -C7.5 -mk_lms -S3498014304

# I wonder what it will look like if I bump up the steps and set facial enhancement to full strength?
dream> a cute child playing hopscotch -G1.0 -s100 -S -1
reusing previous seed 3498014304
[...]
outputs/img-samples/000040.3498014304.png: "a cute child playing hopscotch" -G1.0 -s100 -b1 -W512 -H512 -C7.5 -mk_lms -S3498014304
~~~~



## Weighted Prompts

You may weight different sections of the prompt to tell the sampler to attach different levels of
priority to them, by adding :(number) to the end of the section you wish to up- or downweight.
For example consider this prompt:

~~~~
    tabby cat:0.25 white duck:0.75 hybrid
~~~~

This will tell the sampler to invest 25% of its effort on the tabby
cat aspect of the image and 75% on the white duck aspect
(surprisingly, this example actually works). The prompt weights can
use any combination of integers and floating point numbers, and they
do not need to add up to 1.

## Personalizing Text-to-Image Generation

You may personalize the generated images to provide your own styles or objects by training a new LDM checkpoint
and introducing a new vocabulary to the fixed model.

To train, prepare a folder that contains images sized at 512x512 and execute the following:

~~~~
# As the default backend is not available on Windows, if you're using that platform, execute SET PL_TORCH_DISTRIBUTED_BACKEND=gloo
(ldm) ~/stable-diffusion$ python3 ./main.py --base ./configs/stable-diffusion/v1-finetune.yaml \
                                            -t \
                                            --actual_resume ./models/ldm/stable-diffusion-v1/model.ckpt \
                                            -n my_cat \
                                            --gpus 0, \
                                            --data_root D:/textual-inversion/my_cat \
                                            --init_word 'cat'
~~~~

During the training process, files will be created in /logs/[project][time][project]/
where you can see the process.

conditioning* contains the training prompts
inputs, reconstruction the input images for the training epoch
samples, samples scaled for a sample of the prompt and one with the init word provided 

On a RTX3090, the process for SD will take ~1h @1.6 iterations/sec.

Note: According to the associated paper, the optimal number of images
is 3-5. Your model may not converge if you use more images than that.

Training will run indefinately, but you may wish to stop it before the
heat death of the universe, when you find a low loss epoch or around
~5000 iterations.

Once the model is trained, specify the trained .pt file when starting
dream using

~~~~
(ldm) ~/stable-diffusion$ python3 ./scripts/dream.py --embedding_path /path/to/embedding.pt --full_precision
~~~~

Then, to utilize your subject at the dream prompt

~~~
dream> "a photo of *"
~~~

this also works with image2image
~~~~
dream> "waterfall and rainbow in the style of *" --init_img=./init-images/crude_drawing.png --strength=0.5 -s100 -n4
~~~~

It's also possible to train multiple tokens (modify the placeholder string in configs/stable-diffusion/v1-finetune.yaml) and combine LDM checkpoints using:

~~~~
(ldm) ~/stable-diffusion$ python3 ./scripts/merge_embeddings.py \
                                            --manager_ckpts /path/to/first/embedding.pt /path/to/second/embedding.pt [...] \
                                            --output_path /path/to/output/embedding.pt
~~~~

    Pass argument --full_precision to dream.py to get slower but more accurate image generation


## Installation

There are separate installation walkthroughs for [Linux/Mac](#linuxmac) and [Windows](#windows).

### Linux/Mac

1. You will need to install the following prerequisites if they are not already available. Use your
operating system's preferred installer
* Python (version 3.8.5 recommended; higher may work)
* git

2. Install the Python Anaconda environment manager using pip3.
```
~$ pip3 install anaconda
```
After installing anaconda, you should log out of your system and log back in. If the installation
worked, your command prompt will be prefixed by the name of the current anaconda environment, "(base)".

3. Copy the stable-diffusion source code from GitHub:
```
(base) ~$ git clone https://github.com/lstein/stable-diffusion.git
```
This will create stable-diffusion folder where you will follow the rest of the steps.

4. Enter the newly-created stable-diffusion folder. From this step forward make sure that you are working in the stable-diffusion directory!
```
(base) ~$ cd stable-diffusion
(base) ~/stable-diffusion$
```
5. Use anaconda to copy necessary python packages, create a new python environment named "ldm",
and activate the environment. 
```
(base) ~/stable-diffusion$ conda env create -f environment.yaml
(base) ~/stable-diffusion$ conda activate ldm
(ldm) ~/stable-diffusion$
```
After these steps, your command prompt will be prefixed by "(ldm)" as shown above.

6. Load a couple of small machine-learning models required by stable diffusion:
```
(ldm) ~/stable-diffusion$ python3 scripts/preload_models.py
```

Note that this step is necessary because I modified the original
just-in-time model loading scheme to allow the script to work on GPU
machines that are not internet connected. See [Workaround for machines with limited internet connectivity](#workaround-for-machines-with-limited-internet-connectivity)

7. Now you need to install the weights for the stable diffusion model.

For running with the released weights, you will first need to set up an acount with Hugging Face (https://huggingface.co).
Use your credentials to log in, and then point your browser at https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v-1-4-original.
You may be asked to sign a license agreement at this point.

Click on "Files and versions" near the top of the page, and then click on the file named "sd-v1-4.ckpt". You'll be taken
to a page that prompts you to click the "download" link. Save the file somewhere safe on your local machine.

Now run the following commands from within the stable-diffusion directory. This will create a symbolic
link from the stable-diffusion model.ckpt file, to the true location of the sd-v1-4.ckpt file.
   
```
(ldm) ~/stable-diffusion$ mkdir -p models/ldm/stable-diffusion-v1
(ldm) ~/stable-diffusion$ ln -sf /path/to/sd-v1-4.ckpt models/ldm/stable-diffusion-v1/model.ckpt
```

8. Start generating images!
```
# for the pre-release weights use the -l or --liaon400m switch
(ldm) ~/stable-diffusion$ python3 scripts/dream.py -l

# for the post-release weights do not use the switch
(ldm) ~/stable-diffusion$ python3 scripts/dream.py

# for additional configuration switches and arguments, use -h or --help
(ldm) ~/stable-diffusion$ python3 scripts/dream.py -h
```
9. Subsequently, to relaunch the script, be sure to run "conda activate ldm" (step 5, second command), enter the "stable-diffusion" 
directory, and then launch the dream script (step 8). If you forget to activate the ldm environment, the script will fail with multiple ModuleNotFound errors.

#### Updating to newer versions of the script

This distribution is changing rapidly. If you used the "git clone" method (step 5) to download the stable-diffusion directory, then to update to the latest and greatest version, launch the Anaconda window, enter "stable-diffusion", and type:
```
(ldm) ~/stable-diffusion$ git pull
```
This will bring your local copy into sync with the remote one.

### Windows

1. Install Anaconda3 (miniconda3 version) from here: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/

2. Install Git from here: https://git-scm.com/download/win

3. Launch Anaconda from the Windows Start menu. This will bring up a command window. Type all the remaining commands in this window.

4. Run the command:
```
git clone https://github.com/lstein/stable-diffusion.git
```
This will create stable-diffusion folder where you will follow the rest of the steps.

5. Enter the newly-created stable-diffusion folder. From this step forward make sure that you are working in the stable-diffusion directory!
```
cd stable-diffusion
```

6. Run the following two commands:
```
conda env create -f environment.yaml    (step 6a)
conda activate ldm                      (step 6b)
```
This will install all python requirements and activate the "ldm" environment which sets PATH and other environment variables properly.

7. Run the command:
```
python scripts\preload_models.py
```

This installs several machine learning models that stable diffusion
requires. (Note that this step is required. I created it because some people
are using GPU systems that are behind a firewall and the models can't be
downloaded just-in-time)

8. Now you need to install the weights for the big stable diffusion model.

For running with the released weights, you will first need to set up
an acount with Hugging Face (https://huggingface.co).  Use your
credentials to log in, and then point your browser at
https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v-1-4-original.  You
may be asked to sign a license agreement at this point.

Click on "Files and versions" near the top of the page, and then click
on the file named "sd-v1-4.ckpt". You'll be taken to a page that
prompts you to click the "download" link. Now save the file somewhere
safe on your local machine.  The weight file is >4 GB in size, so
downloading may take a while.

Now run the following commands from **within the stable-diffusion
directory** to copy the weights file to the right place:
   
```
mkdir -p models\ldm\stable-diffusion-v1
copy C:\path\to\sd-v1-4.ckpt models\ldm\stable-diffusion-v1\model.ckpt
```
Please replace "C:\path\to\sd-v1.4.ckpt" with the correct path to wherever
you stashed this file. If you prefer not to copy or move the .ckpt file, 
you may instead create a shortcut to it from within
"models\ldm\stable-diffusion-v1\".

9. Start generating images!
```
# for the pre-release weights
python scripts\dream.py -l

# for the post-release weights
python scripts\dream.py
```
10. Subsequently, to relaunch the script, first activate the Anaconda command window (step 3), enter the stable-diffusion directory (step 5, "cd \path\to\stable-diffusion"), run "conda activate ldm" (step 6b), and then launch the dream script (step 9).

#### Updating to newer versions of the script

This distribution is changing rapidly. If you used the "git clone" method (step 5) to download the stable-diffusion directory, then to update to the latest and greatest version, launch the Anaconda window, enter "stable-diffusion", and type:
```
git pull
```
This will bring your local copy into sync with the remote one.

## Simplified API for text to image generation

For programmers who wish to incorporate stable-diffusion into other
products, this repository includes a simplified API for text to image generation, which
lets you create images from a prompt in just three lines of code:

~~~~
from ldm.simplet2i import T2I
model   = T2I()
outputs = model.txt2img("a unicorn in manhattan")
~~~~

Outputs is a list of lists in the format [[filename1,seed1],[filename2,seed2]...]
Please see ldm/simplet2i.py for more information.


## Workaround for machines with limited internet connectivity

My development machine is a GPU node in a high-performance compute
cluster which has no connection to the internet. During model
initialization, stable-diffusion tries to download the Bert tokenizer
and a file needed by the kornia library.  This obviously didn't work
for me.

To work around this, I have modified ldm/modules/encoders/modules.py
to look for locally cached Bert files rather than attempting to
download them. For this to work, you must run
"scripts/preload_models.py" once from an internet-connected machine
prior to running the code on an isolated one. This assumes that both
machines share a common network-mounted filesystem with a common
.cache directory.
